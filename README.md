# Bank-Service-Counter-Simulation
A simple Call Center Simulation in C using queues and time-based processing. The program allows adding incoming calls, assigning them to available agents, and simulating each time unit as agents handle and complete calls. Demonstrates FIFO queue operations, multi-agent task handling, and basic real-time simulation logic.
